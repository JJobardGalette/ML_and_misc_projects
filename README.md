In this repo, you can find the various Machine Learning project that I have done through here, the file Reinforcement Learning present various school projects and some of my own implementations of some algorithms. NLP presents the projets I did in Natural Language Processing (mainly an end project for a KTH course). In ML are other various Machine Learning Project, such as the Coll√®ge de France and ENS Data Challenge.

I also added some other projects such as my interactive mandelbrot set with python using jit, and a website about river-level in french brittany
